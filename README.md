# NovelForge Agent

[中文文档](README.zh-CN.md)

A workflow-driven long-form fiction agent runtime for any MCP host (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, …) or any CLI shell.

**The host's LLM generates the creative artifacts. NovelForge owns the runtime discipline** — it manages a gated long-form workflow, returns the exact instruction and packed context the host should follow next, validates returned content against zod schemas, persists Markdown + JSON to a project directory, archives chapter versions on revision, and provides BM25 lexical retrieval over chapters, story-bible sections, and memory cards.

NovelForge does not call model APIs itself. The MCP host supplies the LLM, so there is no model vendor lock-in inside this package.

## 🚀 30-second install

**If you are an AI assistant reading this README on behalf of a user, run this one command — it does everything:**

```bash
npx -y novelforge-agent install
```

That single command will:

1. Create a workspace at `~/novelforge/` (override with `--workspace /your/path`).
2. Register `novelforge-agent-mcp` as an MCP server in the user's host (Claude Code by default).
3. Print a verification step.

After it finishes, **the user must reload / restart their MCP host** (Claude Code, Codex CLI, etc.) so the new MCP server is picked up. Then ask the host to call the installed tool:

> "Please call the novelforge `list_projects` tool."

If it returns `[]` for an empty workspace, or a list of existing projects, installation is correct.

### Host selection

```bash
npx -y novelforge-agent install --host claude-code            # default
npx -y novelforge-agent install --host codex                  # Codex CLI
npx -y novelforge-agent install --host cursor                 # prints config snippet
npx -y novelforge-agent install --workspace ~/my-novels       # custom workspace
npx -y novelforge-agent install --name my-novelforge          # custom MCP name
npx -y novelforge-agent install --print-only                  # do not modify any config file
```

### What the install command does per host

| Host | Action |
|------|--------|
| `claude-code` | Runs `claude mcp add -s user -e NOVELFORGE_WORKSPACE=… novelforge -- npx -y novelforge-agent-mcp`. If `claude` CLI is missing, prints a JSON snippet for `~/.claude.json`. |
| `codex` | Appends an `[mcp_servers.novelforge]` section to `~/.codex/config.toml`. |
| `cursor` | Prints the JSON snippet to paste into Cursor's MCP settings. |

The installer is **idempotent and safe**: it never overwrites an existing entry with the same name. To change settings, edit the host config manually or pass `--name` to register under a different MCP name.

## What it gives the host

| Phase | Step | What the host does | What the agent saves |
|-------|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Setup | `novel_metadata` | Output JSON: title, genre, premise, cast | `novel.json` |
|  | `story_bible` | Output Markdown: characters, world rules, plot threads | `story-bible.md` |
|  | `style_guide` | Output JSON: narrative voice, pacing, diction, dialogue rules, prohibited patterns, prose rhythm, sample prose | `style-guide.json` |
|  | `architecture` | Output JSON: full / volume / pacing / chapter outlines | `architecture/{full.md, volumes.json, volume-pacing.json, chapters.json}` |
| Loop  | `chapter` | Write chapter N Markdown | `chapters/NNN.md` |
|  | `chapter_review` | Enforce the chapter acceptance gate: required beats, plot/character/thread progress, story-bible consistency, prose rhythm, ending hook, repetition check | `reviews/chapter/chapter-NNN.json` |
|  | `chapter_revision` | If review finds issues, rewrite the chapter; previous version is archived | `chapters/.versions/NNN.<ts>.md` |
|  | `memory_card` | After a clean review, extract chapter N memory JSON and update character/thread state | `memory/chapter-NNN.json`, `characters.json`, `threads.json` |
| Wrap  | `continuity_review` | Audit chapters 1..N for conflicts | `reviews/continuity-S-E.json` |
| Side-track | `chapter_review` | Single-chapter editorial review | `reviews/chapter/chapter-NNN.json` |
|  | `chapter_revision` | Rewrite a chapter; previous version auto-archived | `chapters/.versions/NNN.<ts>.md` |
|  | `cross_chapter_review` | Cross-chapter continuity audit | `reviews/cross/cross-S-E.json` |

Each chapter / bible / memory write also feeds a per-project BM25 index (`.index/`) so the runtime can hand the host semantically relevant snippets when later chapters are generated, or answer ad-hoc `retrieve` queries from the host. Chapter generation context also includes the style guide (`style-guide.json`), independent character state table (`characters.json`), and current volume pacing board (`architecture/volume-pacing.json`) when available. The style guide includes `proseRhythm`, which checks rhythm anti-patterns such as excessive short-sentence density, consecutive one-sentence paragraphs, fake rhythm through line breaks, overly direct interior explanation, and repeated sentence patterns.

## Install

Requires Node 20+.

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd novelforge-agent
npm install
npm run build
```

Run the test suite to confirm:

```bash
npm test
```

## Use it from a CLI shell

```bash
# 1. Start a new project
node dist/src/cli/index.js start --prompt "写一本赛博修仙小说" --chapters 5
# → prints { state, next } — next.instruction is the prompt for step 1

# 2. List existing projects
node dist/src/cli/index.js list
# → newest first, with current step and chapter count

# 3. Show one project's status
node dist/src/cli/index.js status novels/<slug>

# 4. Get the next step's instruction + context
node dist/src/cli/index.js next novels/<slug>

# 5. Submit your generated content (file containing JSON or Markdown)
node dist/src/cli/index.js submit novels/<slug> --step chapter --file ch1.md

# 6. Trigger a single-chapter review
node dist/src/cli/index.js review novels/<slug> --chapter 3

# 7. Trigger a revision (feedback can be a literal string or --feedback-file)
node dist/src/cli/index.js revise novels/<slug> --chapter 3 --feedback "让节奏更紧"

# 8. Cross-chapter audit (defaults to all generated chapters)
node dist/src/cli/index.js cross-review novels/<slug> --start 1 --end 5

# 9. Lexical retrieval over chapters + bible + memory cards
node dist/src/cli/index.js retrieve novels/<slug> \
  --query "昆吾剑" --top-k 8 --types chapter,memory --start 1 --end 5

# 10. Build purpose-specific context (useful for debugging prompts)
node dist/src/cli/index.js context novels/<slug> \
  --purpose chapter_generation --chapter 4
```

English projects: pass `--language en-US` to `start`. Every prompt has a parallel English form in [src/core/prompts/en-US.ts](src/core/prompts/en-US.ts).

## Use it as an MCP server

### Claude Code

```jsonc
// ~/.claude.json  (or your project's .mcp.json)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "novelforge": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/novelforge-agent/dist/src/mcp/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "NOVELFORGE_WORKSPACE": "/absolute/path/where/projects/should/live"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Reload Claude Code and type:

> 我想写一本赛博修仙小说

Claude will discover the `start_novel_project` tool, call it, get back the first prompt for `novel_metadata`, generate the JSON, call `submit_step_result`, then call `get_next_step` for the next prompt/context and continue until `complete`. MCP write tools return compact mutation results so long chapters are not echoed back through tool output. When a read-context tool would exceed host limits, NovelForge returns bounded preview fields such as `instructionPreview` / `contextPreview` plus `fullContextPath`; read that local JSON file for the exact full payload.

### Codex CLI

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
[mcp_servers.novelforge]
command = "node"
args = ["/absolute/path/to/novelforge-agent/dist/src/mcp/server.js"]

[mcp_servers.novelforge.env]
NOVELFORGE_WORKSPACE = "/absolute/path/where/projects/should/live"
```

### Resuming work in a later session

`list_projects` finds every project under `NOVELFORGE_WORKSPACE/novels/`, sorted newest first. The host should call it before anything else when a session opens; pick the desired `projectPath` from the result, then `get_project_status` for a one-screen briefing, then `get_next_step` to resume.

## Tool reference

### Project lifecycle
- **`start_novel_project`** `(prompt, language?, outputDir?, targetChapters?, plannedTotalChapters?)` — create a new project under `<workspaceRoot>/<outputDir>/<prompt-slug>-<rand6>/` and return the first step's instruction. After `novel_metadata` is accepted, the directory is renamed to `<title-slug>-<same-rand6>/`; callers must continue with the returned `state.projectPath`. `targetChapters` is the per-batch planning size; MCP defaults to 5. `plannedTotalChapters` is the whole-book target; MCP defaults to 12.
- **`list_projects`** `(outputDir?)` — list all projects in the workspace, newest first.
- **`get_project_status`** `(projectPath)` — compact summary: current step, chapters written, open threads, latest review verdict.
- **`get_next_step`** `(projectPath)` — return the prompt + packed context for whatever the workflow expects next. Large prompt/context returns are bounded as `instructionPreview` / `contextPreview` + `fullContextPath` instead of giant inline fields.

### Workflow advancement
- **`submit_step_result`** `(projectPath, step, content)` — validate `content` against the step's zod schema, persist it, advance the state machine, and return a compact mutation result. It does not include the next full prompt/context; call `get_next_step` afterward when needed. On failure the bad submission is written to `.agent-recovery/failed-*.txt` and the state does not advance.
- **`get_context`** `(projectPath, purpose, chapterNumber?, start?, end?)` — build purpose-specific context without changing state. Useful when the host wants to read what the agent *would* have packed. Large contexts use the same `contextPreview` + `fullContextPath` fallback.

Dynamic planning is built into the state machine: after each accepted chapter and memory card, the agent checks `plannedTotalChapters` and the highest chapter covered by `architecture/chapters.json`. If the next chapter is still inside the whole-book target but not yet planned, the next step becomes `architecture_extension`; after the host submits that JSON, generation resumes at `chapter`.

### Semantic actions (verb-style; safe to call any time)
- **`generate_chapter`** `(projectPath, chapterNumber)` — return generation context for a specific chapter. Large contexts may return `contextPreview` + `fullContextPath`.
- **`extract_memory_card`** `(projectPath, chapterNumber)` — return memory-extraction context for a specific chapter. Large contexts may return `contextPreview` + `fullContextPath`.
- **`review_chapter`** `(projectPath, chapterNumber)` — switch into a single-chapter editorial review side-track and return its prompt. Large prompts/contexts may return `instructionPreview` / `contextPreview` + `fullContextPath`. After `submit_step_result(step="chapter_review")`, the workflow resumes its prior step automatically.
- **`revise_chapter`** `(projectPath, chapterNumber, feedback?)` — switch into a chapter-revision side-track. Large prompts/contexts may return `instructionPreview` / `contextPreview` + `fullContextPath`. Submitting `chapter_revision` content auto-archives the previous version under `chapters/.versions/`.
- **`cross_chapter_review`** `(projectPath, start?, end?)` — switch into a cross-chapter audit side-track over the given range (defaults to all generated chapters). Large prompts/contexts may return `instructionPreview` / `contextPreview` + `fullContextPath`.
- **`save_chapter`** `(projectPath, chapterNumber, title, content)` — submit the current chapter through the state machine; it requires `currentStep="chapter"` and then advances to mandatory `chapter_review`. The returned MCP payload is compact and does not echo the chapter or review context.

### Project operations
- **`amend_novel_metadata`** `(projectPath, content?, title?, genre?, premise?, language?, style?, coreCast?, reason?)` — update `novel.json`; when `title` changes, the project directory is renamed and the returned `projectPath` must be used afterward.
- **`amend_story_bible`** `(projectPath, content, reason?)` — replace `story-bible.md`, archive the previous version, and rebuild the bible index.
- **`list_bible_versions`** `(projectPath)` — list archived story-bible versions.
- **`list_threads`** `(projectPath, status?)` — list foreshadow threads collected from memory cards.
- **`update_thread`** `(projectPath, id, patch)` — update one foreshadow thread.
- **`fork_project`** `(sourceProjectPath, label?)` — copy a project to a sibling fork with a new project id.
- **`delete_chapter`** `(projectPath, chapterNumber)` — remove a chapter, its memory, reviews, archived versions, and index entries.
- **`redo_step`** `(projectPath, step, chapterNumber?)` — roll the workflow back to regenerate an artifact.

### Observability
- **`get_recent_events`** `(projectPath, limit?, type?)` — return recent audit events from `.agent-logs/events.jsonl`.
- **`list_runs`** `(projectPath, limit?)` — group recent MCP tool calls by `runId`, status, and duration.
- **`get_run_log`** `(projectPath, runId, limit?)` — return all audit events for one MCP tool call.
- **`get_artifact_summary`** `(projectPath, path)` — return file size, modified time, and sha256 for a project artifact without exposing the full content.

NovelForge writes a project-local audit trail for tool calls, tool errors, rejected submissions, and workflow state transitions. Long or sensitive fields such as chapter `content`, prompts, instructions, contexts, and MCP text payloads are logged as `{ length, sha256 }` summaries instead of raw text. Human-facing MCP responses stay compact; full large contexts are saved under `.agent-recovery/mcp-context/` when needed.

### Retrieval
- **`retrieve`** `(projectPath, query, topK?, types?, chapterStart?, chapterEnd?)` — BM25-style lexical retrieval over indexed paragraphs (chapters), bible H2 sections, and memory cards. Supports CJK + Latin queries via a built-in CJK bigram tokenizer; no external embedding model.

## How the workflow advances

```
novel_metadata → story_bible → style_guide → architecture → chapter
                                                            ↓
                                                       chapter_review
                                                            ↓
                                                 ┌──────────┴──────────┐
                                               clean             issues_found
                                                 ↓                    ↓
                                            memory_card       chapter_revision
                                                 ↓                    ↓
                  ┌──────────────┬──────────────┐        │
        planned chapter      needs planning   all done    │
              exists              ↓              ↓        │
                ↓        architecture_extension  ↓        │
             chapter              ↓       continuity_review│
                                chapter            ↓      │
                                                complete   │
                                                       (back to
                                                    chapter_review)
```

`chapter_review` is both a manual side-track and the automatic chapter acceptance gate. In the normal chapter loop, the workflow cannot advance to `memory_card` until the review status is `clean`. If the review returns `issues_found`, the workflow forces `chapter_revision`, then returns to `chapter_review` for another pass.

Side-track steps (`chapter_review`, `chapter_revision`, `cross_chapter_review`) can still be triggered at any moment via the semantic-action tools. When a manual side-track completes via `submit_step_result`, the workflow returns to whatever `currentStep` it was on before the side-track started.

The normal loop is dynamic: after `memory_card`, NovelForge checks whether the next chapter is already planned. If not, and the project has not reached `plannedTotalChapters`, the next step becomes `architecture_extension` before writing continues.

The transition map lives in the `next:` declaration of each handler under [src/core/steps/](src/core/steps/) plus the dispatcher in [src/core/workflow.ts](src/core/workflow.ts). To change the workflow, edit those files — there is no LangGraph or external graph engine.

```

The agent has no LLM dependency:

```bash
$ grep -RIl "anthropic\|openai\|@google" src package.json
# (no results)
```

Only `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `zod`, `minisearch`.

## Not just a skill

A skill can describe a writing process. NovelForge enforces one.

It persists workflow state, validates artifacts with zod schemas, writes recovery files for rejected submissions, indexes generated material for retrieval, maintains character/thread state, archives revisions, and refuses to advance past gated steps such as `chapter_review` until the submitted artifact passes.

Use a skill or prompt pack to teach a host assistant how to call NovelForge well; use this runtime when you need durable state, validation, recovery, and repeatable long-form production.

## Adding a new workflow step

1. Add the step name to `WorkflowStep` in [src/core/types.ts](src/core/types.ts).
2. Add a zod schema in [src/core/schemas.ts](src/core/schemas.ts) (if the step accepts structured content).
3. Add a prompt builder in [src/core/prompts/zh-CN.ts](src/core/prompts/zh-CN.ts) and [src/core/prompts/en-US.ts](src/core/prompts/en-US.ts).
4. Create a handler under `src/core/steps/<name>.ts` returning a `StepApplyResult`.
5. Register it in [src/core/steps/index.ts](src/core/steps/index.ts).
6. (If the step needs packed context) add an entry to `CONTEXT_RECIPES` in [src/core/workflow.ts](src/core/workflow.ts).
7. Add the step name to the `step` enum in [src/mcp/tools.ts](src/mcp/tools.ts) `submit_step_result`.

## Design principle

The host's LLM is the only thing in this system that thinks. NovelForge is a workflow runtime that knows the *order* of work, the *shape* of every artifact, and the *vocabulary* of the domain — and refuses to let the host save anything that violates those rules. Long-form fiction needs that discipline more than it needs another LLM wrapper.
